//## Challenge Function Drills

//- Write a function called `identity(input)` that takes in an argument called
//input and returns that input.

function identity(input){
    return input;
}

//- Write a function called `getRandomNumber(min, max)` that returns a random
//number between min and max values sent to that function call.

/*
let min = 1
let max = 15
function getRandomNumber(min, max){
    return randomNum = Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}
getRandomNumber(min, max);
*/

//- Write a function called `first(input)` that returns the first character in the
//provided string.

/*
let input = "Foo"
function first(input){
    return inout.charAt(0);
}
first(inout);
*/

//- Write a function called `last(input)` that returns the last character of a
//string

/*
let input = "foofu"
function last(input){
    return input.charAt(input.length -1);
}
last(input);
*/

//- Write a function called `rest(input)` that returns everything but the first
//character of a string.

//- Write a function called `reverse(input)` that takes a string and returns it
//reversed.

//- Write a function called `isNumeric(input)` that takes an input and returns a
//boolean if the input is numeric.

//- Write a function called `count(input)` that takes in a string and returns the
//number of characters.

//- Write a function called `add(a, b)` that returns the sum of a and b

//- Write a function called `subtract(a, b)` that return the difference between
//the two inputs.

//- Write `multiply(a, b)` function that returns the product

//- Write a `divide(numerator, denominator)` function that returns a divided by b

//- Write a `remainder(number, divisor)` function that returns the remainder left
//over when dividing `number` by the `divisor`

//- Write the function `square(a)` that takes in a number and returns the number
//multiplied by itself.

//- Write a function called `sumOfSquares(a, b)` that uses only your `add()` function
//and your square function and not + or * operators

//- Write a function called `doMath(operator, a, b)` that takes 3 parameters. The
//first parameter is the name of the math function you want to apply. a and b
//are the two numbers to run that function on.

//## Even More Function Bonuses

//1. Create a function that will return how many whitespace characters are at the
//beginning and end of a string.

//1. Create a function that takes in two string inputs.

//- If the second string input is present in the first, return the first input
//string with the second input string removed from it.
//- If the second string input is present multiple times in the first, the
//second string will only be removed where it first occurs in the first
//string.
//- If the second string input is not present in the first, return the first
//string as entered in the function.

//1. Create a function that takes in a string and returns true if the last letter
//is an "a" (otherwise, return false).

//1. EXTRA CHALLENGE: create a function that will return how many whitespace
//characters are at the beginning of a string (hint: use regex).

//1. Create a function `returnTrueMessage()` that returns the string "Hey, it's true!"

//- Create a function `returnFalseMessage()` that returns the string "Hey, it's false!"
//- Create a function `returnMessage()` that takes in a function and returns the call to the function
//- Experiement passing in different functions.

//1. Create a function, `willLoginUser()` that takes in a username string,
//   password string, user age, a boolean indicating if they are an admin.

//The function will return true if the username is not the same as the
//password and the user is at least 18 years old. If the user is an admin,
//they do not have to be a certain age but the password must still not match
//the username.
