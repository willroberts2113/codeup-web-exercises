<dl>
    <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Where can I find a park map?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can view maps on specific park websites or find national park, National Park System, National Trails System, and other maps.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>How do I make reservations for camping/lodging in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">For campground reservations, visit Recreation.gov. Not all parks participate in this service; many campgrounds are first come, first served. For more information on specific camping and lodging services offered at the park(s) of your interest, please check specific park websites. You can also learn more about camping in national parks and find a map of parks with camping opportunities.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>How do I reserve a tour in a park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">You can book some park tours through Recreation.gov such as Pearl Harbor National Memorial, many Mammoth Cave National Park cave tours, Independence National Historical Park tours, and more. Not all parks participate in this reservation service. For more information on tours offered at a specific park, please see the park search.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Can I bring my pet to a national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Some national parks welcome petsâ€”in developed areas, on many trails and campgrounds, and in some lodging facilities. Learn more about pets in parks.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>Can I bring my service dog to a national park?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Yes, service dogs are legally permitted anywhere in a park that visitors can go. Learn more about service animals in national parks, including the difference between service animals and emotional support animals.</dd>
    <br>
    <dt>What do I need to know about driving off road in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">Before you head out, check with the national parks that you intend to visit. In many national parks, off-road driving is illegal. Where off-road driving is allowed, the National Park Service regulates it.</dd>
